for any vector where all components are under half of the max distance, there is another vector that is the same
there may be a case then to be made for the use of bit fields
	this can create an expressive system the only needs information for colout as direction is encoded  

for light volumes, it could be a combination of on demand tracing and only using propogation 
in order to get more fine detail shadows, trace a certain distance towards the light stepping up in the tree
	if nothing is found take the light at its perscribe value, otherwise modify
	however this keeps the distance required to be traced to minimum
other option is follow the volumes all the way back to the source if possible


possibilty: split the tree structure and the node data
	this will massivley help reuse data nodes by allowing level agnostic nodes
	ever tree node has a tree indexing array for sure
	two options to this: 
		data nodes hold 8 chunks of information, and each tree node only references one - preferable?
		data nodes hold information for only one octant, and tree holds array reference each indiviually


TODO: find a solution using info below
optimal for 3080 is using 8x4 workgroup and fifo. still worried that the extreme lows come from the prior frame running too fast????
when ran using render doc, the extreme lows are not seen but neither are the extreme highs, so it may be something to do with the ultra fast frames
