possibilty: split the tree structure and the node data
	this will massivley help reuse data nodes by allowing level agnostic nodes
	ever tree node has a tree indexing array for sure
	two options to this: 
		data nodes hold 8 chunks of information, and each tree node only references one - preferable?
		data nodes hold information for only one octant, and tree holds array reference each indiviually


TODO: find a solution using info below
optimal for 3080 is using 8x4 workgroup and fifo. still worried that the extreme lows come from the prior frame running too fast????
when ran using render doc, the extreme lows are not seen but neither are the extreme highs, so it may be something to do with the ultra fast frames

math of spatial propogation:



notes on rust in general
	:mut differences when defining something
		- mut infront of var name will create a var itself that can be changed
		- &mut is put infront of the type instead of the var beause it modifies the type itself, rather than the behaviour of the variable
	:self is the default var name for self, while Self is the default type holder, this also goes for fn, where fn represents function while Fn represents a function as a type
